# Regime Detection Model

A Self-Improving RL Trading Agent built in structured phases — starting from HMM-based market regime labeling and progressively extending to a full Safe RL trading system.

---

## Project Vision

The overall goal is to build a production-grade, risk-aware RL trading agent that:

- Detects the current **market regime** (Bullish / Bearish / Sideways/Choppy)
- Uses regime context to decide **whether to trade** and in which direction
- Optimizes **risk-adjusted return** (CVaR) rather than raw profit
- Learns to **adapt** to new market conditions via self-improving RL

**Universe:** Nifty 50 stocks (NSE, India)

## Architecture Roadmap

```
Phase 1  →  HMM Regime Labeling          ✅ COMPLETE
Phase 2  →  Transformer Regime Classifier (price features only)
Phase 3  →  Add Sentiment (FinBERT + news)
Phase 4  →  Uncertainty + Transition Detection heads
Phase 5  →  Safe RL Trading Agent (PPO/SAC + CVaR)
```

## Phase 1 — HMM Regime Labeling ✅

### What It Does

Downloads 6 years (2019–2025) of OHLCV data for all **50 Nifty 50 stocks**, engineers 15+ technical features, and applies a **3-state Gaussian HMM** per ticker to label each trading day as:

| Label | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Bull | Green | Trending upward, positive mean return |
| 🔴 Bear | Red | Trending downward, negative mean return |
| 🟡 Sideways | Yellow | Choppy/ranging, near-zero mean return |

State → regime mapping is principled: states sorted by **mean log return** so label assignment is automatic and data-driven.

### Results (49/50 stocks labelled)

| Regime | Avg % of Trading Days |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Bull | 36.4% |
| 🔴 Bear | 21.8% |
| 🟡 Sideways | 41.8% |

## Design Philosophy

> **Regime-first.** Markets are non-stationary. Trading in the wrong regime (choppy/sideways) destroys returns via transaction costs and noise. By detecting regime *before* placing trades, the agent acts only when there is structural edge — either a clear uptrend or downtrend.

### Key Design Decisions

- **HMM for labeling**: Unsupervised, principled, industry-standard for latent regime discovery
- **State smoothing**: 3-day minimum run to avoid single-day noise labels
- **Posterior probabilities**: Every row carries `prob_Bull`, `prob_Bear`, `prob_Sideways` — giving the downstream RL agent soft regime information rather than hard labels
- **Walk-forward validation**: Each phase validated on held-out time windows before proceeding
